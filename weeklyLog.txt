--NOAHS WEEKLY LOG!--

9/27: organized files, read paper discussing ENF signals
10/4: with Jon and Howie, wrote proposal. Brainstormed general strategy for how to extract ENF signal from audio
10/11: worked with Jon and Howie on matlab code to generalize reading in data provided by IEEE. Saved all the data in a convenient format to use for testing later on. Set up github for the project and showed Jon and Howie how to use it. Made a gameplan for how to split up the work going forward
10/18: Began to try to extract the ENF signal from the audio files provided as specified in a paper found. The paper gives a clear method for how to extract it and we'll see if it gives results as expected.
10/25 Continued to try to extract ENF signal. Finished implementing STFT algorithm and began working on QIFFT algorithm. Went over Jon and Howie's progress on the classifier
11/1 Went over the QIFFT function with Jon and Howie. Extensively debugged it to make sure the results made sense. 
11/8 Finished the overall ENF extraction process. Began the switch from Matlab to Python
11/15 Prepared Senior Project poster with Jon and Howie. rewrote the ENF extractor code so to generate useful figures to put in the poster
